# SFA Challenge - SWISS FEDERAL ARCHIVES GEO UNPLUGGED

The GEO Unplugged Submission was created with the purpose in mind to access the SFA data catalog via regions versus the current country filter. The SFA filter currently in place makes it complex and slow to search for files related to a certain region or multiple countries.

The GEO Unplugged proof of concept demonstrates the possibility to search for regions and should provide as well a simple way to explore the data.

This Submission is purely written in Javascript and takes advantage of JQuery. Any kind of feedback is highly appreciated. Thank you for reading this ReadMe!
